					<h3>MUGG & BEAN</h3>
					<p>Our story. In the early 90’s, Ben Filmalter and his wife Judi discovered a little coffee shop on the South Side in Chicago. It was unique as it prided itself on its spirit of generosity.
With this in mind, Ben went home and opened the first Mugg & Bean in 1996 at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town.
From the beginning Mugg & Bean prided itself on generous portions and we were amongst the first restaurants in South Africa to serve Bottomless Coffee.
But Ben wanted more than just a restaurant. He wanted a place where people arrived as customers and left as friends.
This seed of generosity sprouted and our history began writing itself. In less than 7 years Mugg & Bean had grown to over 80 restaurants nation wide. Today you can find us in 220 locations across Africa.
Mugg & Bean is now the place where you are always welcome, where you always get more and more. For this we raise our bottomless mugs to Ben, a man who will always be remembered as Mr Generosity.</p>
